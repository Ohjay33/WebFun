<!-- Updating Records
The SQL command pattern for updating/editing records is as follows: -->

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

<!-- IMPORTANT: if WHERE condition is not added to the UPDATE statement, the changes will be applied to every record in the table. -->
